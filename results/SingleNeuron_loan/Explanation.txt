This is using the SAT solver to process the loan data.
in TrainTestData/Loan_Training_Data.xlsx and
Loan_Validation_Data.xlsx. The original loan data is in loan_approval_dataset.xlsx
It was then processed into training and testing set as follows:

Summary of Processing
Missing Values: No missing values detected.
Categorical Encoding: education, self_employed, and loan_status have been numerically encoded.
Normalization: Numerical features have been scaled to a range of 0 to 1.
Feature Selection: The loan_id column was dropped as it is not relevant for predictions.
Data Splits:
Training Set: 3,415 samples
Validation Set: 854 samples
Target Class Distribution:
Class 0 (Rejected): 2,656 instances
Class 1 (Approved): 1,613 instances
Feature Columns
The following features are included:

no_of_dependents
education
self_employed
income_annum
loan_amount
loan_term
cibil_score
residential_assets_value
commercial_assets_value
luxury_assets_value
bank_asset_value

It attains an accuracy of Accuracy,85.48% training on 92 samples, but skipping
sample 73 (which is UNSAT).

Confirming with the training set:
ltd_92_skipped_73_valid_train.csv with accuracy 98.91% (training set)
- which is what you would expect because sample 73 has been plucked out (which leads to unsat) 1/92 = 0.981
ltd_72_valid_valid = Accuracy 87.94% <- highest accuracy
ltd_50_50_valid_valid = Accuracy 72.00%
ltd_10_valid_valid = Accuracy 40.00%
